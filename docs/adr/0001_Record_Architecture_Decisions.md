# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to maintain knowledge and provide context for future developers.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard, to document important architectural decisions in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Decisions are documented and traceable
- Context and reasoning are preserved
- New team members can understand why decisions were made
- Prevents re-discussing already-made decisions

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain ADRs
- Additional documentation overhead

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: No formal documentation

- **Description**: Rely on code comments and informal documentation
- **Pros**: No overhead, faster development
- **Cons**: Knowledge is lost, decisions are forgotten, context is unclear
- **Why not chosen**: Important architectural decisions need formal documentation

### Alternative 2: Design documents

- **Description**: Create comprehensive design documents for major decisions
- **Pros**: Detailed documentation
- **Cons**: Too heavyweight, harder to maintain, less focused
- **Why not chosen**: ADRs are lightweight and focused on specific decisions
