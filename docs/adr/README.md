# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for OSM-Notes-WMS.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project. They help:

- Track why decisions were made
- Understand the context and alternatives considered
- Share knowledge with the team
- Avoid revisiting the same decisions

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating the decision
- **Decision**: The decision made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-0001](0001_Record_Architecture_Decisions.md): Record Architecture Decisions
- [ADR-0002](0002_Use_GeoServer_For_WMS.md): Use GeoServer for WMS
- [ADR-0003](0003_Use_Same_Database_As_Ingestion.md): Use Same Database as Ingestion
