## What is WMS?

WMS (Web Map Service) is a way to view OSM notes on a map. Think of it as a special layer that shows
you where people have left notes about mapping issues, just like you might leave a sticky note on a
map.

### Why Use WMS?

- **See the Big Picture**: View all notes in an area at once
- **Identify Patterns**: Notice where many notes are clustered
- **Prioritize Work**: Focus on areas that need attention
- **Track Progress**: See which areas have been recently worked on

### What You'll See

The WMS layer shows OSM notes as colored dots on the map:

- **Red Dots**: Open notes (issues that need attention)
- **Green Dots**: Closed notes (issues that have been resolved)

The color intensity tells you how old the note is:

- **Darker colors**: Older notes
- **Lighter colors**: Newer notes

> **Technical Details:** For information about WMS layer configuration, styling, and server setup,
> see [WMS_Guide.md](./WMS_Guide.md).

## Understanding the Map

### Color Coding

#### Open Notes (Red Dots)

| Color          | Meaning                         | Priority                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Dark Red**   | Recently opened (last few days) | High - Check soon                |
| **Medium Red** | Open for a few weeks            | Medium - Plan to address         |
| **Light Red**  | Open for months                 | Low - May need special attention |

#### Closed Notes (Green Dots)

| Color            | Meaning              | Information         |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Dark Green**   | Recently closed      | Recently resolved   |
| **Medium Green** | Closed some time ago | Previously resolved |
| **Light Green**  | Closed long ago      | Historical data     |

### Spatial Patterns

#### What to Look For

1. **Clusters of Red Dots**
   - Indicates an area with many open issues
   - May need systematic mapping work
   - Could be a complex feature (shopping center, university, etc.)

2. **Sparse Areas**
   - Few notes might mean well-mapped area
   - Or could mean the area hasn't been surveyed

3. **Linear Patterns**
   - Notes along roads suggest road mapping issues
   - Notes along rivers suggest water feature issues
   - Notes along boundaries suggest administrative issues

4. **Recent Activity**
   - Dark red dots in an area suggest recent mapping activity
   - Could indicate ongoing mapping projects

### Interpreting Note Density

#### High Density Areas (>10 notes per km²)

- **Urban centers**: Complex areas with many features
- **Transportation hubs**: Stations, airports, major intersections
- **Tourist areas**: Hotels, restaurants, attractions
- **Construction zones**: Areas with ongoing development

#### Medium Density Areas (2-10 notes per km²)

- **Suburban areas**: Residential neighborhoods
- **Commercial districts**: Shopping areas
- **Industrial zones**: Factories, warehouses

#### Low Density Areas (<2 notes per km²)

- **Rural areas**: Farmland, forests
- **Parks and recreation**: Natural areas
- **Well-mapped areas**: Already completed mapping

## Best Practices

### When to Use WMS

#### Good Times to Check WMS

- **Before starting mapping work** in a new area
- **When planning mapping sessions** to prioritize areas
- **After completing work** to see if you missed anything
- **When coordinating with other mappers** to avoid duplication

#### How to Use WMS Effectively

1. **Start with a wide view** to see overall patterns
2. **Zoom in** to specific areas of interest
3. **Combine with other data sources** (satellite imagery, existing OSM data)
4. **Use transparency** to see underlying map features
5. **Check regularly** as notes are constantly being added

### Layer Management

#### Transparency Settings

- **0-30%**: Good for seeing underlying map features
- **30-50%**: Balanced view of notes and map
- **50-70%**: Emphasizes notes over map
- **70-100%**: Notes only (use with other imagery)

#### Zoom Levels

- **Zoom 0-8**: Overview of large areas
- **Zoom 9-12**: City/regional level
- **Zoom 13-15**: Neighborhood level
- **Zoom 16+**: Street level detail

### Combining with Other Data

#### Recommended Layer Combinations

1. **WMS + Satellite Imagery**: See notes against real-world features
2. **WMS + OSM Data**: Compare notes with existing mapping
3. **WMS + GPS Tracks**: Plan efficient mapping routes
4. **WMS + Administrative Boundaries**: Understand jurisdictional issues

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Planning a Mapping Session

**Situation**: You want to map a new neighborhood

**Steps**:

1. **Check WMS layer** for the area
2. **Look for red dots** (open notes)
3. **Prioritize areas** with many recent notes
4. **Plan your route** to hit high-priority areas first
5. **Check again** after mapping to see if you missed anything

### Scenario 2: Quality Control

**Situation**: You've completed mapping an area

**Steps**:

1. **Enable WMS layer** to see notes
2. **Look for any red dots** in your mapped area
3. **Investigate notes** that seem relevant to your work
4. **Address issues** or mark notes as resolved
5. **Update your mapping** if needed

### Scenario 3: Coordinating with Others

**Situation**: Working with a mapping team

**Steps**:

1. **Share WMS layer** with team members
2. **Identify areas** with many notes
3. **Divide work** based on note density
4. **Communicate** about areas you're working on
5. **Update team** when notes are resolved

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### WMS Layer Not Loading

**Symptoms**:

- Layer appears but shows no data
- Error messages about connection
- Blank or gray tiles

**Solutions**:

1. **Check internet connection**
2. **Verify WMS URL** is correct
3. **Try refreshing** the layer
4. **Check with administrator** if service is running

#### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**:

- Slow loading of tiles
- Application becomes unresponsive
- High memory usage

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce zoom level** (don't zoom in too far)
2. **Adjust transparency** to reduce rendering load
3. **Close other applications** to free memory
4. **Use smaller bounding boxes** if possible

#### Color Confusion

**Symptoms**:

- Can't distinguish between note types
- Colors seem wrong
- Hard to see against background

**Solutions**:

1. **Adjust transparency** for better contrast
2. **Use different background** (satellite vs. map)
3. **Zoom in/out** to see different detail levels
4. **Check layer properties** for style settings
