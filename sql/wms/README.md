# Configure Notes WMS

Notes WMS is a layer service that locates the open and closed notes on a map.
This layer can be included in JOSM or Vespucci to easily locate notes, and
process them by location.
By having the location of notes from a wide perspective, one can zoom in on
the areas where the notes are still open.
This service does not provide a lot of zoom detail, because it is only
necessary to have a rough idea of where open notes are located.

As part of the service, it also locates closed notes.
This allows us to identify areas where many notes have been opened, and imagine
the reason why.

This service uses the OSM Notes ingestion system, which maintains an updated set
of notes (open and closed).
To make WMS work some changes on the database are necessary, to copy just
the necessary values into another table, with the geometry already created.
This speeds up the queries for the WMS, without impacting the notes base table.

Then, it is necessary to configure GeoServer (which only needs to be downloaded)
and the basic configuration is explained here.

The layer is configured with a style (SLD file) that changes the color of the
note according to its age.
When open notes, the older the darker the note, meaning it has less value than
recently open notes.
When closed notes, the lighter the older, meaning it was processed long before.

## Installation

### Schema Verification (Recommended First Step)

Before installing WMS components, verify that your database schema matches the expected schema from OSM-Notes-Ingestion:

```bash
# Verify database schema compatibility
psql -d notes -f sql/wms/verifySchema.sql
```

This script checks:
- PostGIS extension installation
- Required columns in `notes` table
- Existence of `countries` table
- Data availability

If verification fails, ensure you have the correct version of OSM-Notes-Ingestion installed and that the database has been properly populated.

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

Use the WMS manager script for easy installation and management:

```bash

# Install WMS components
./bin/wms/wmsManager.sh install

# Check installation status
./bin/wms/wmsManager.sh status

# Remove WMS components
./bin/wms/wmsManager.sh remove

# Show help
./bin/wms/wmsManager.sh help
```

The WMS manager script includes:

- ✅ Automatic validation of prerequisites (PostgreSQL, PostGIS)
- ✅ Database connection testing
- ✅ Installation status checking
- ✅ Safe installation with conflict detection
- ✅ Force reinstallation option
- ✅ Dry-run mode for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### Manual Installation

For manual installation, follow these steps:

## Database configuration

- Provide a password to the database user.

```text
ALTER USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
```

- Change the database configuration to allow remote connections.
This link could be useful:
<https://www.bigbinary.com/blog/configure-postgresql-to-allow-remote-connection>
Also, you can find the configuration file with this:

```text
find / -name "postgresql.conf" 2> /dev/null
```

And modify the file to make Postgres listen from any address:

```text
vi /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf

listen_addresses = '*'
```

Restart the service:

```text
sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service
```

Allow users to connect remotely:

```text
find / -name "pg_hba.conf" 2> /dev/null
vi /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf
host    all             all              0.0.0.0/0                       md5
host    all             all              ::/0                            md5
```

- Execute the necessary SQLs to adapt the database to synchronize with this
service.
Let's suppose the Postgres database is called `notes`.

```text
psql -d "notes" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f "prepareDatabase.sql"
```

## Geoserver configuration

Configure the GeoServer to publish the layer from the database, following
these instructions.

```text
SELECT /* Notes-WMS */ 
  year_created_at, 
  year_closed_at, 
  id_country,
  country_shape_mod,
  geometry
FROM wms.notes_wms
WHERE year_closed_at IS NULL

```

### Styles

For each layer.

#### Publishing

- Default

#### Basic Resource Info

__On the Publishing tab:__

#### WMS Settings - Layers Settings

- Additional Styles: OSM_Notes:CloseNotes

The other options the same as for open notes.

__Disputed and Unclaimed Areas__

This layer uses a __materialized view__ because the query is computationally
expensive (ST_Union over all countries, ST_Difference operations). The view is
automatically refreshed when `updateCountries.sh` runs (typically monthly).

To manually refresh the view:

```bash
psql -d notes -f sql/wms/refreshDisputedAreasView.sql
```

Or using SQL:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY wms.disputed_and_unclaimed_areas;
```

__On the Data tab:__

Layer from OSM_Notes:OSM_Notes_DS.

- View Name: Disputed and Unclaimed Areas layer
- SQL Statement:

```text
SELECT /* Disputed-WMS */ id, geometry, zone_type, country_ids, country_names
FROM wms.disputed_and_unclaimed_areas
ORDER BY zone_type, id
```

- Geometry Column: `geometry`
- SRID: `4326`

#### Basic Resource Info

- Abstract: This layer shows disputed areas (overlapping countries) and
  unclaimed areas (gaps between countries). The view is automatically refreshed
  monthly when country boundaries are updated.

__On the Publishing tab:__

#### WMS Settings - Layers Settings

- Additional Styles: OSM_Notes:DisputedAndUnclaimedAreas

The other options the same as for open notes.

__Note__: Disputed areas are shown in red, unclaimed areas in yellow. Maritime
zones (those with parentheses in name, e.g., "Colombia (200nm EEZ)") are excluded
from both disputed and unclaimed areas calculation, as they can legitimately overlap
with countries and each other (EEZ zones) and are intentionally not claimed
(international waters).

- Maximum tile cache size: 5 GB

### BlobStores

- Add new:
- Type of BlobStore: File BlobStore
